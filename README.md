# confluence-reader

You can't open Confluence pages using
[EWW](https://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/manual/html_mono/eww.html) because it requires Javascript.
And sure, Confluence gives you the ability to create super-duper dynamic pages. But, and thank
heavens and all deities for that, most of the times the pages people create are just text and images.  
This package has three commands:

* `confluence-search`: enter some text, get results, hit `RET` on any of them to display the page.
  By default it uses standard "text contains" search, invoke with prefix arg to type you own
  [CQL](https://developer.atlassian.com/cloud/confluence/advanced-searching-using-cql/) with
  advanced operators.
* `confluence-page-by-id`: if you have a page id (you can see them in the URL when on the browser)
  you can use this to jump directly to that page. It isn't very practical :) but it is used
  internally by the other commands.
* `confluence-page-from-url`: just paste the URL from your browser in the minibuffer and this will
  get the page id from the URL (using the very scientific method of splitting by "/" chars)

In the page view, you can see the page exported in glorious plain HTML. No matter how you get to the
page view, while on it you have three bindings:  
* `q`, the usual "quit window" command
* `RET` over a link to open it. More about this below.
* `b` calls `bookmark-set`, to bookmark the current page in the standard Emacs bookmarking facility.

When rendering a page, this package tries to identify links to other Confluence pages to handle
those internally. The internal links have a "‚û°Ô∏è" character, while the ones handled by the usual
`browse-url` machinery have "üîó" next to them. Table of content/anchor links aren't supported, so
they get disabled (but still have an underline).

### Configuration 

    (use-package confluence-reader :load-path "/path/to/this/repo"
      :custom
      (confluence-host "thecompany.atlassian.net")
      :commands
      (confluence-search confluence-page-by-id))
      
You need to create a token in JIRA and add it to any `auth-source` enabled location, for example in
your `.authinfo` or `.authinfo.gpg` file:

    machine thecompany.atlassian.net login youruser@thecompany.com password your-token-here
